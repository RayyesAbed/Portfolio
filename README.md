# ABED Website

Welcome to my portfolio website - a personal space where I organize my story, work, and contact options into 4 sections:

1. Welcome - A friendly introduction for visitors.
2. Projects - Where I display the personal projects that I have been working on (currently developing PlanIt).
3. About - A brief summary about my life story, how I started and how I became a full stack web developer, including my resume.
4. Contact: Reach out to me by sending an E-Mail. You can also follow me on GitHub or LinkedIn.
